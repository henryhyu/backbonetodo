# backbonetodo

A Todo App to learn Backbone.js.

Backbone.js gives structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

The bulk of Backbone consists of Events, Views, Models, Collections, and Routers.
